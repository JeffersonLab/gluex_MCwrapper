c This card configures the simulation program to act purely as a
c Monte Carlo event generator, and not to actually track any of the particles
c that it generates. The events are written to the output file with only the
c MC section filled out (reactions tag). This file can be fed back later to
c HDGeant using the INFILE card above to carry out the actual simulation.
c This provides access to the built-in photon beam generator of HDGeant to
c someone who wants to study the properties of the beam apart from its
c interactions in the target. Three keywords are currently supported.
c    'precol'   - single-photon events starting upstream of the primary
c                 collimator, with correlated spatial and momentum
c                 distributions for the well-tuned GlueX beamline.
c    'postcol'  - single-photon events starting downstream of the secondary
c                 collimator. Beam photons have been tracked through the
c                 system of collimators and sweep magnets but then stopped
c                 before entry into the pair spectrometer.
c    'postconv' - e+e- pair and e+e-/e-recoil events generated in the
c                 TPOL target. Beam photons have been tracked through
c                 the system of collimators and then pair-converted in
c                 the TPOL coverter using a custom polarization-sensitive
c                 pair/triplet production generator. They are saved as
c                 a single vertex within the PTAR target.
c The first two modes are supported by both HDGeant and HDGeant4, while
c postconv is only supported at present by HDGeant4.
