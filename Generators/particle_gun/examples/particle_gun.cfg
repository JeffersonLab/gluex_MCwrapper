c The following card enables single-track generation (for testing).
c For a single-particle gun, set the momentum (GeV/c), direction
c theta,phi (degrees) and vertex position (cm), and for the particle
c type insert the Geant particle type code plus 100 (eg. 101=gamma,
c 103=electron, 107=pi0, 108=pi+, 109=pi-, 114=proton).  If you use
c the particle code but do not add 100 then theta,phi are ignored
c and the particle direction is generated randomly over 4pi sr.
c For a listing of the Geant particle types, see the following URL.
c http://wwwasdoc.web.cern.ch/wwwasdoc/geant_html3/node72.html
c The meaning of the arguments are as follows.
c  - particle = GEANT particle type of primary track + 100
c  - momentum = initial track momentum, central value (GeV/c)
c  - theta = initial track polar angle, central value (degrees)
c  - phi = initial track azimuthal angle, central value (degrees)
c  - delta_momentum = spread in initial track momentum, full width (GeV/c)
c  - delta_theta = spread in initial track polar angle, full width (degrees)
c  - delta_phi = spread in initial track azimuthal angle, full width (degrees)
c
c If you do explicitly specify the momentum/angle (by adding 100 as
c described above, you may also choose to distibute tracks evenly in
c log(P) or log(theta) by setting the appropriate PLOG and TLOG flags
c to a non-zero value.
c PLOG 1
c TLOG 1

c The TGTWIDTH card is used to determine an extended volume from
c which the particle gun will generate vertexes. The vertex position
c is sampled evenly from a cylindrical volume whose radius is given
c by the first parameter and whose full z-extent is given by the second.
c The volume is centered on the coordinates specified by SCAP above.
c If the card is not specified, then both the r and z extent default
c to zero meaning the vertex is always located at the point specified
c by SCAP. Note that this only affects the particle gun. Events read
c from a file contain their own vertex information.
